# Visual Studio Code Clone Project

This is my first HTML page creation as part of the **Harkirat Cohort 3 Web Development Course**.  
In this project, I attempted to **clone the Visual Studio Code website** in a static manner using markup language.  

This project is a foundational step in exploring web development, focusing on structure, design, and layout.
